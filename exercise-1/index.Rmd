Using the documentation on plotly's website I have created a choropleth map.  
This map is created using information from their website on US agriculture exports by state.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2011_us_ag_exports.csv")
df$hover <- with(df, paste(state, '<br>', "Beef", beef, "Dairy", dairy, "<br>",
                           "Fruits", total.fruits, "Veggies", total.veggies,
                           "<br>", "Wheat", wheat, "Corn", corn))
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa')
)

plot_geo(df, locationmode = 'USA-states') %>%
        add_trace(z = ~total.exports, text = ~hover, locations = ~code, color = ~total.exports, colors = 'Blues') %>%
        colorbar(title = "Millions USD") %>%
        layout(title="Example of Plotly Interactive Map", geo = g)
```
